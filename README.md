Fig.1 Samples demonstrations from advanced layout control methods and our proposed DippDiff approach. Our method aims to address two key challenges in controllable layout generation for digital textile printing patterns: inaccurate layout control (including missing objects within bounding boxes, incorrect object categories, and inaccurate spatial layouts) and erroneous color binding, thereby fundamentally improving the capability of generating fine-grained textile digital printing patterns with complex spatial layouts.
